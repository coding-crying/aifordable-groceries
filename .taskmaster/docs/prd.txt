# AIFordable Groceries: Flexible POC Development Plan

## Project Overview
Build an interactive POC demonstrating the AIfordable Groceries core value proposition using OpenAI Real-Time Agents. This is NOT a production application - it's a compelling demonstration to validate technical feasibility and secure buy-in for full production development.

## Success Criteria
- Demonstrate viable cost-optimization engine
- Justify $20-$40 monthly subscription model
- Achieve "wow factor" for stakeholder buy-in
- Validate technical feasibility of real-time conversational commerce

## Technology Stack
- Backend: Node.js/TypeScript (OpenAI Real-Time Agents base)
- Frontend: React/Next.js
- Communication: WebSocket (real-time)
- APIs: OpenAI Realtime API, MealMe API, Nutrition API (Spoonacular/Edamam)
- Future: PostgreSQL for user memory

## Development Phases

### Phase 0: Foundation & Familiarization
**Objective**: Establish stable development environment and understand demo architecture

**Key Tasks**:
- Clone openai-realtime-agents-demo repository
- Configure environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY)
- Run demo locally and confirm functionality
- Study codebase architecture:
  - Agent definition patterns
  - Tool definition and integration
  - WebSocket connection handling
  - Message flow and streaming events

**Success Metric**: Explain end-to-end data flow and run demo reliably

### Phase 1: Core Backend Logic Implementation
**Objective**: Replace generic demo tools with AIfordable Groceries business logic

**Key Tools to Implement**:

1. **Nutrition Tool**
   - Function: `getRecipes(preferences: {dietary_needs: string[], nutrient_focus: string[], cook_time_max_minutes: number})`
   - Initial: Return 2-3 hardcoded recipes with prep_time, cook_time, tools_needed
   - Define tool schema for OpenAI agent

2. **Commerce Tools**
   - Function: `getGroceryPrices(ingredients: string[], location: string)`
   - Function: `optimizeCart(priceData: PriceData, budget: number)`
   - Initial: Mocked price data for 2+ fictional stores
   - POC optimization: Simple heuristic showing multi-store cost optimization

**Success Metric**: Agent responds to "Find me cheap vegan meals under 30 minutes" by calling correct functions in sequence

### Phase 2: Frontend Transformation
**Objective**: Transform generic UI into branded AIfordable Groceries interface

**Key Tasks**:
- Implement AIfordable Groceries branding (colors, typography, logo)
- Create hybrid input with preference buttons (High Protein, Quick Meals, Vegetarian)
- Build rich content renderers:
  - RecipeCard component (image, title, prep/cook time, tools needed)
  - OptimizedCart component (grouped by store, prices, totals)

**Success Metric**: Branded, intuitive interface showing formatted recipes and multi-store shopping lists

### Phase 3: End-to-End Integration
**Objective**: Create seamless user flow demonstrating full value proposition

**Key Tasks**:
- Craft detailed system prompt defining agent persona and workflow
- Integrate live APIs (Nutrition API, MealMe API)
- Implement real-time status updates during API calls
- Define "Golden Path" demonstration flow

**Golden Path Example**: 
User requests $100 budget, high-protein vegan meals for 2 people → Agent presents 3 recipes → User selects one → Agent returns optimized cart from 2 stores totaling $92.50

**Success Metric**: Stakeholder can use application without instruction to generate cost-optimized grocery list

## Core Features

### MVP Functionality
- Real-time conversational interface
- Recipe recommendation based on preferences
- Multi-store price comparison
- Cart optimization algorithm
- Branded user experience

### Future Enhancements (Post-POC)
- PostgreSQL database integration
- User feedback loop system
- Order history tracking
- Advanced personalization engine
- Subscription ROI tracking

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Requirements
- OpenAI Real-Time API integration
- Custom tool definitions for nutrition and commerce
- Mocked data initially, live API integration in Phase 3
- Streaming status updates

### Frontend Requirements
- React/Next.js components
- WebSocket connection management
- Rich data visualization
- Responsive design
- Preference input controls

### API Integrations
- OpenAI Realtime API (core)
- MealMe API (grocery prices)
- Nutrition API (recipes - Spoonacular or Edamam)

## Business Value Proposition
- Demonstrate cost optimization engine effectiveness
- Show real-time conversational commerce viability
- Validate subscription model through cumulative savings display
- Prove technical feasibility for full production investment

## Constraints & Assumptions
- POC focus: Speed and demonstration over production quality
- Simplified optimization algorithm acceptable for demonstration
- One perfect user journey preferred over multiple partial flows
- Mocked data acceptable in early phases
- Live API integration required for final phase only
